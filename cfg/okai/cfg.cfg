r_shadowmaxrendered			"24"	
// def. ""		# Max. count of rendered Shadow [TF2-VideoConfigMenu: 0=min 32=High]. I set it to '24' because usually there aren't 32 players alive, no less in your viscinity, so you'll save FPS in huge firefights where you won't need to see every shadow (i.e. usefully through walls).

mat_clipz				"1"	
// def. ""		# If set to 1, uses an optimization technique to reduce what is drawn on screen for a performance improvement. Note that some Nvidia FX card owners need to set mat_clipz 0 to fix rendering problems.

mat_envmapsize				"0"	// def. "128"		# EnviromentMap -> Background Images in not reachable Sections of the Map, same as the skybox | Greater Size value better Imagequality

mat_envmaptgasize			"0"	// def. "32"		# UNKOWN -> EnviromentMap Size for Skybox ? Greater value better Imagequality (max 512 ?)

snd_pitchquality 0
// reduces sampling rate for sound from 44khz (CD quality) to 22khz (more compressed). It will make sounds more squished together and sharper, but you might not mind or notice. Give it a shot.
dsp_enhance_stereo "0"
// Good to use '0' if you're not on headphones or if you use a sound card for surround sound emulation. Removes some unnecessary dsp effects, as well as some sound spacialization features meant for headphones. If you have trouble locating sounds after adding this, remove it.

dsp_slow_cpu "1"
// renders fewer sounds and removes some unnecessary ones. Careful...if you feel like you're not hearing things happening around you that you should, set to '0'.

snd_mix_async "0"
// if set to "1" will try to use multicore rendering for sound. However, it may produce an annoying delay with sounds being played. If not, use it.

snd_spatialize_roundrobin "0"
// Lowend optimization: if nonzero, spatialize only a fraction of sound channels each frame. 1/2^x of channels will be spatialized per frame.
